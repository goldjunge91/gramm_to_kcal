/**
 * Server-only user database utilities.

 * Note: Better Auth handles core user management (creation, updates, deletion).
 * This file contains only application-specific user utilities if needed.

// Better Auth handles all user management internally through its API:
// - User creation: auth.api.signUpEmail()
// - User updates: auth.api.updateUser()
// - User deletion: auth.api.deleteUser()
// - Get session: auth.api.getSession()

// If you need custom user operations beyond Better Auth's capabilities,
// add them here with caution to avoid conflicts with Better Auth's internal user management.
