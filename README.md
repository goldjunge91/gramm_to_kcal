pnpm create playwright
that directory, you can run several commands:

pnpm exec playwright test
Runs the end-to-end tests.

pnpm exec playwright test --ui
Starts the interactive UI mode.

pnpm exec playwright test --project=chromium
Runs the tests only on Desktop Chrome.

pnpm exec playwright test example
Runs the tests in a specific file.

pnpm exec playwright test --debug
Runs the tests in debug mode.

pnpm exec playwright codegen
Auto generate tests with Codegen.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

    pnpm exec playwright test

And check out the following files:

- ./**e2e**/example.spec.ts - Example end-to-end test
- ./tests-examples/demo-todo-app.spec.ts - Demo Todo App end-to-end tests
- ./playwright.config.ts - Playwright Test configuration

# Interactive mode with algorithm performance focus

claude --append-system-prompt "When writing code, prioritize algorithm efficiency and performance optimization. Always analyze time and space complexity and suggest performance improvements."

# Start session with security mindset

claude --append-system-prompt "You are a senior backend engineer specializing in secure API development. Prioritize input validation, authentication, and proper error handling. Always include rate limiting and logging."

Practical Development Examples
Code review specialist - You could use this when you need thorough code analysis:

claude --append-system-prompt "You are conducting a senior-level code review. Focus on: 1) Performance bottlenecks, 2) Security vulnerabilities, 3) Code maintainability, 4) Test coverage gaps. Provide specific line-by-line feedback with improvement suggestions."

Legacy code modernization - Helpful when working with older codebases:

claude --append-system-prompt "You are modernizing legacy code. Prioritize backwards compatibility while introducing modern patterns. Always explain migration strategies and potential breaking changes."

hen to Use System Prompts
Print mode scenarios:

Single-task focus - Working on one specific type of problem that needs expert attention
Code review sessions - Adding consistent review criteria for quality checks
Specialized analysis - Security audits, performance optimization, or architecture review
Interactive mode scenarios:

Long coding sessions - Maintaining consistent expertise and focus throughout development
Performance optimization - Focusing on algorithm efficiency and performance improvements across an entire project
Learning sessions - Having Claude teach specific concepts or patterns consistently
